I almost burned out twice between december 2018 and april 2019, so I decided to finally do something I wanted to do for a long time: start my own blog. Apart from having a place to articulate my thoughts, it was also a way of learning how to build, host and support a WordPress blog.

Setting it up was done fairly quickly, but it took me some time after to really understand what I was doing with all the plugins and optimizations. I first had my blog hosted by a web-hosting company, but in March of 2020 I transferred the site to a self-hosted AWS Lightsail instance.

**Frameworks**:

* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)

**Techniques**:

* HTML
* CSS

**Hosting**:

* [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/)
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
* [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)

**Demo**:

This site has been deprecated in favor of a [React based blog](/joeplaa-com-react-blog). So unfortunately no demo.
