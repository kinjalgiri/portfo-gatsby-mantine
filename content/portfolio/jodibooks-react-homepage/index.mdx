Having roughly split our ([jodiBooks](https://jodibooks.com)) software in a front-end and back-end part, I took responsibility for the front-end. Our existing homepage was build in C# with the .NET MVC framework. This meant that I couldn't fully develop and support it, because I have no C# background. Also it made the homepage unnecessarily complex and heavy.

I rebuild the homepage with the Next.js framework. I styled the website with React and Bootstrap and used JavaScript to code dynamic parts (e.g. the efulfillment calculator). The Next.js tooling allowed me to compile the homepage into a static website, which is hosted in AWS CloudFront.
