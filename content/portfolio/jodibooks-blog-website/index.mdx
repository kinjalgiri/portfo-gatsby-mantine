Diana set up a WordPress blog, initially for me to, well, blog about and for [jodiBooks](https://blog.jodibooks.com). I learned to use it and took over the responsibility to keep it running.

I tried to make it as fast as possible by adding caching and using a minimal theme. In the end I had to compromise pure speed for usability and the ability to make it look as similar as possible to our other websites.

Most recently I redid the hosting and added additional caching (Redis). I'm slowly moving more and more articles from the blog to other websites. The manual has already been moved to the [docs](https://docs.jodibooks.com) pages, the wiki will be next. In the end I also want to build our blogsite in React.

**Frameworks**:

* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)

**Techniques**:

* HTML
* CSS

**Hosting**:

* [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
* [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)

**Demo**:

This site has been deprecated in favor of a [React based blog](/jodibooks-react-blog). So unfortunately no demo.
