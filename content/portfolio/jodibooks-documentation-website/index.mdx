Our ([jodiBooks](https://docs.jodibooks.com)) user manual (application documentation) was put together in WordPress together with our blog. This made it hard to find for our customers and hard to maintain for us.

I build a dedicated docs website with Docusaurus. This tool makes it easy to write documentation using Markdown. It renders a website using React and then compiles the complete website into a static website, which is hosted in AWS CloudFront.

**Frameworks**:

* [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (v2)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

**Techniques**:

* HTML
* JavaScript
* Markdown

**Hosting**:

* [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

**Demo**:
