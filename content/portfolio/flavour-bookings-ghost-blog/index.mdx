My sister decided she should (finally) start doing what she herself wanted to do. She loves food and reading and wanted to share that. A blog seemed to be a good place to start. I helped her setup a website on which she shows what dishes she makes, reviews the restaurants she visits and discusses the books she's read. 

I helped her get started by setting up a Ghost blog on AWS Lightsail. She did the design and content herself. The only thing I do for her is making sure the server keeps running and regular backups are made.
