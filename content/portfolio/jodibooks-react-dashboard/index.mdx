The first [jodiBooks](https://beauty.jodibooks.com) dashboard was build with [ASP.NET anc C#](/jodibooks-dashboard-redesign). Although this framework works fine, in modern days it has some drawbacks. JavaScript has matured and offers us more possibilities to improve the user experience.

So we rebuild the dashboard as a webapp with the Next.js framework. The dashboard is styled with React and Material-UI. We used TypeScript to code dynamic parts (e.g. fetching and posting data from and to our API). The Next.js tooling allowed me to compile the app into a static website, which is hosted in AWS CloudFront.

**Frameworks**:

* [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

**Techniques**:

* JSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
* TypeScript

**Hosting**:

* [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
