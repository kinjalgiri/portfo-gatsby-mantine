Our customers want to have an easy way to schedule appointments with their customers. To help them do that, we are expanding the [jodiBooks](https://beauty.jodibooks.com) Beauty software with a calendar.

We build the calendar as a webapp with the Next.js framework. The calendar is based on React Big Calendar, which I styled with React and Bootstrap. We used JavaScript to code dynamic parts (e.g. fetching and posting data from and to our API). The Next.js tooling allowed me to compile the app into a static website, which is hosted in AWS CloudFront.

**Frameworks**:

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Big Calendar](https://jquense.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html)

**Techniques**:

* CSS/SCSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
* TypeScript

**Hosting**:

* [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

**Demo**:
