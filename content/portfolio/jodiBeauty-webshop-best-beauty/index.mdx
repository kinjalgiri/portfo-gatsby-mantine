When asked for any special wishes, one of our customers mentioned she'd like to have a webshop someday. She wasn't in any rush back then, but as Covid hit, we quickly build a webshop for her. We plan to integrate this shop further into [jodiBooks](https://jodibooks.com), but for now we could help her out quickly by configuring a Spree Commerce stack.
