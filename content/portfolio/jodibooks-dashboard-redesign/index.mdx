This was my first big "coding" project for [jodiBooks](https://jodibooks.com). I thought the website and our dashboard could look better, so I tried. I migrated Bootstrap from v3 to v4 and when I got the hang of it started redesigning.

I ended up redoing the menu, layout, buttons, colors, lists, etc. During this project I learned a lot about HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I also had to get familiar with responsive web desing. The dashboard is (apart from a single page) fully mobile-ready.

**Frameworks**:

* [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) (in Visual Studio)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

**Techniques**:

* HTML
* CSS

**Demo**:

* The jodiBooks dashboard (free demo): <https://beauty.jodibooks.com>
