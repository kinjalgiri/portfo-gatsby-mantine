Our customers want to have an easy way to schedule appointments with their customers. To help them do that, we are expanding the [jodiBooks](https://beauty.jodibooks.com) Beauty software with a calendar. To make it easier for our customers' customers to make an appointment (and to save our customers time, less manual scheduling) we are offering a booking plugin. This plugin can also be added to their own website.

I build the plugin as a webapp with the Next.js framework. I styled the app with React and Bootstrap and used JavaScript to code dynamic parts (e.g. fetching and posting data from and to our API). The Next.js tooling allowed me to compile the app into a static website, which is hosted in AWS CloudFront.

**Frameworks**:

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org//)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

**Techniques**:

* CSS/SASS (SCSS)
* HTML
* JavaScript

**Hosting**:

* [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

**Demo**:
